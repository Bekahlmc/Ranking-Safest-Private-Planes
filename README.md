## The Business Need

A luxury resort chain, Destination Hotel and Resorts (DHR), is opening a new location in Martha's Vineyard and intends to purchase private planes for guest transportation from mainland airports to the island resort property. The primary goal is to prioritize the safety of guests and mitigate risks during transportation. Additionally, DHR aims to identify, of the most cost-effective plane, the plane with the maximum aircraft range, and the plane with the greatest passsenger capacity amongst the safest options. 

### Safety First:
Data analysis will focus on evaluating a database of historical incident and accident rates of different aircrafts. From these records we will extract a list the safest potential private jet options.
  - *How do we measure safety when looking at historical records of aircraft accidents and incidents?*
  - *Based on statistical analysis and chosen safety measuring method, what can we determine are the safest private jets to recommend to DHR?*

### Other Incidental Considerations:
After compiling a list of the safest private jets, we'll also compare cost, range, and passenger capacity of the planes.
  - *Which option is the most cost effective?*
  - *Which option can travel the longest distance?*
  - *Which option can transport the largest amount of guest*

**Stakeholders: Destination Hotel and Resorts owners and investors, resort guests, and DHR employees**
