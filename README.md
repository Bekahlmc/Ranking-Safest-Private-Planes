## The Business Need

The luxury travel resort, White Lotus, is opening a new location in Martha's Vineyard and intends to purchase private planes for guest transportation from mainland locations to the island resort property. White Lotus takes great pride in its renowned commitment to delivering a luxurious and exclusive experience, with private air travel being an integral component at this location. The primary goal is to prioritize the safety of guests and mitigate risks during transportation. Furthermore, among the safest options, White Lotus aims to pinpoint the most cost-effective and the most high-end choice.

### Safety First:
Data analysis will focus on evaluating a database of historical incident and accident rates of different aircrafts. From these records we will extract a list the safest potential private jet options.
  - *How do we measure safety when looking at historical records of aircraft accidents and incidents?*
  - *Based on statistical analysis and chosen safety measuring method, what can we determine are the safest private jets to recommend to White Lotus?*

### Other Incidental Considerations:
After compiling a list of the safest private jets, we'll also compare cost and find a luxury option.
  - *Which option is the most cost effective?*
  - *Which option could White Lotus splurge on for the guest experience?*

**Stakeholders: White Lotus Resorts owners and investors, guests, White Lotus employees**
